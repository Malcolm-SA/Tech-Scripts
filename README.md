Basic powershell scripts used to help manage systems, across Win 10 and 11

AIT_Main_datedreport.ps1 script will autoload any other ps1 scripts found in the same directory and include them in a menu. This is then offered to the user with a report file being generated in the same directory. It is rough as i am still learning, and also hoping i can find more helpful scripts to include in the repository aimed at automation of IT related tasks on the Windows 10 and Windows 11 platforms.
